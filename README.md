Created a Sales Analytic dashboard UI/UX of Dribbble
This project is a pixel-accurate analytics dashboard UI built as a frontend-only application, focusing on layout precision, component structure, and modern UI practices.
The dashboard visually represents sales performance, platform metrics, user activity, and trends using a clean, data-driven design.

🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to recreate a complex dashboard interface using modern frontend tools while maintaining:
Pixel-level accuracy
Clean component architecture
Scalable and readable code
No backend dependency
All data shown is static and mock-based, as the objective was UI and interaction design rather than backend integration.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

React – Component-based UI development
Vite – Fast development server and build tool
Tailwind CSS (latest) – Utility-first styling without PostCSS
Lucide Icons – Consistent and lightweight SVG icons
Vercel – Deployment and hosting
GitHub – Version control and project management

🧩 Architecture & Design Decisions
1. Component-Based Structure
The dashboard is divided into small, reusable components, such as:
Sidebar
Header
Statistic cards
User rows
Platform chart
Sales dynamic chart
This approach improves:
Readability
Reusability
Scalability

2. Pure Frontend (No Backend)

Any backend-related code (schemas, APIs, database logic) was intentionally removed to keep the project frontend-only.
All values are hardcoded or mapped from local arrays to simulate real data.
